  <h3>What is Music Theory?</h3>

  <div class="tentang">
    <h4>Music theory is the study of the fundamental elements that make up music. It encompasses various aspects, including harmony, melody, rhythm, form, and notation. These elements work together to create the rich tapestry of sounds that we experience in music.</h4>

  <h3>Key Concepts in Music Theory</h3>

  <div class="Konsep">
    <h4>Pitch: Pitch is the highness or lowness of a sound. In music theory, pitch is organized into a system of notes that repeat in octaves. The most common system is the Western twelve-tone system, which includes notes like A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, with sharps and flats in between.</h4>
    <hr>
    <h4>Melody: Melody is a sequence of musical notes that form a recognizable musical line. It's often the part of a song that we sing along to or remember most vividly. Melodies are constructed using pitch, rhythm, and phrasing.</h4>
    <hr>
    <h4>Rhythm: Rhythm is the arrangement of beats and durations in music. It's what gives music its sense of time and movement. Musicians use various time signatures and rhythmic patterns to create different rhythmic feels, from the driving beat of a rock song to the flowing rhythms of a waltz</h4>
    <hr>
    <h4>Harmony: Harmony involves the combination of multiple musical notes played or sung simultaneously to create a pleasing sound. Chords, which are groups of notes played together, are the building blocks of harmony. The way chords progress and interact with each other adds depth and emotion to music.</h4>
    <hr>
    <h4>Form: Form refers to the structure of a musical composition. It defines how different sections of a piece are organized and repeated, such as verses and choruses in a song or movements in a symphony. Understanding musical form is essential for both composers and performers</h4>
